# AI tailoring (optional). If --tailor or --tailor-url is used, the resume is adapted to the job description via LLM.
# Tailoring only rephrases and emphasizes your existing content; it does not add new experience or skills.
# On LLM or validation failure, the tool falls back to your base content and logs a warning.

# Local LLM (Ollama) — used by default. Ensure Ollama is running (e.g. ollama serve) and pull a model: ollama pull llama3
RESUME_LLM_MODEL=llama3
# OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434

# Optional: use OpenAI for tailoring. Set OPENAI_API_KEY and pass --openai when running.
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# OpenAI model (used only when --openai; RESUME_LLM_MODEL above is for Ollama only).
# RESUME_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# Max allowed share of LLM-introduced facts (0.0–1.0). Default 0.2 (20%%). Within limit, tailored content is accepted with a warning; over limit triggers a second LLM call to rewrite only the offending experience/project entries.
# RESUME_TAILOR_MAX_FACT_ERROR_RATE=0.2
